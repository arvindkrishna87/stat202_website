The reason I find this odd is that class time feels like a mandatory office hours. Lecture feels like a tldr of the notes and feels remarkably like a waste of time because the required readings effectively cover everything in lecture in greater detail before even going to lecture. If lecture introduced something substantially new or important specific examples that the readings themselves didn't already prove equally as or moreso effectively, but as is, it's mostly just preparing for and doing the activity which can just as easily be done as homework. I think the readings have been phenomenal in that they are comprehensive, interactive, practice/application based, and clear and I have learned so much from them. This unfortunately comes at the detriment that having a participation grade feels more like a burden because of how obsolete the readings make the lecture. ",0.0,4,11,1.0

I said last time, but the Aha slides really feel like they take more away from the class than they bring. I think the engagement/clicker questions are nice, but often it feels like the inherent time for the Aha question is too limiting. It often seems quite easy to miss the question, partly because I don't know what I should be looking at on my computer -should I follow along with the slides, just be sitting on the aha slides screen, or working on the activity during the spoken lecture time?

 

Overall the class feels like it has gotten into a good rhythm of the workflow, although the switch of when reading checks were due was slightly strange around exam 1.
