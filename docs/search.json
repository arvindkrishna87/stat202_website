A typical class will devote 10-15 minutes to discussion/lecture with the remainder of the class devoted to working on activities where students will either work by themselves or in groups. Throughout the class we will discuss and review the work on the activities. In many cases we may come together to work on parts of an activity as a class."

    "section": "Assessment",
    "text": "Assessment\nAssessment for the course is comprised of five components: participation, reading checks, activities, 3 exams, and a final project.\n\nParticipation\nWe will be recording participation through AHA slides. Various times throughout the class we may take a poll or ask a question that you will respond to. The link to the site is provided on the “home page” each day. Participation grades will be curved to 80%. Meaning at the end of the quarter, if you participate at least 80% of the time your participation grade will be 100% (but will not exceed 100%). If you participate 70% of the time, at the end of the quarter your grade will be 70%/80%.\nIf you have an extenuating circumstance that requires you to miss more than 80% of classes then you should contact your advisor or Accessible NU for an accommodation request.\n\n\nReading Checks\nReading checks will be completed using “Tutorials” on RStudio Cloud and uploaded to the course Canvas page. Each reading check will be scaled to be worth 10 points.\nThe lowest three grades will be dropped at the end of the quarter.\n\n\nActivities\nAll daily activities will be graded for completion (10 points fully complete; 5 points partially complete; 0 not complete). This doesn’t mean that your solutions are correct, so make sure that you check them against the solutions.\nThe lowest three grades will be dropped at the end of the quarter.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be 3 in-class exams; they will be structured very similarly to your reading checks. Half of it will focus on conceptual knowledge and half will focus on practical applications. Students will be allowed one 8.5 x 11 inch cheat sheet (front & back) on each in-class exams. The exams are not cumulative.\n\n\nProject\nThe final project will be completed in groups of 3-5 people and allow you to explore a dataset of your choice. More information will be provided later in the quarter.\n\n\nExam Improvement Policy\nWe have worked to develop a policy geared towards a growth mindset. That is, we want a policy where students clearly demonstrate that they have used the exam as a diagnostic tool to learn from and improve their understanding of statistics. There is NO final cumulative exam during the designated final exam time, instead you may choose to retake 1 exam during the exam time. This exam will replace your old score — only in cases where it is an improvement. You must be on-campus to take the exam."

Students register for the full quarter on CAESAR and weekly attendance is expected. Study Groups sessions are listed below course lecture and discussion sections (e.g., STAT 202-SG Peer-Guided Study Group: Introduction to Statistics).\nContact Borislava Miltcheva (pgsg@northwestern.edu) with any questions.\n\nDrop-In Support (No Appointment Needed)\nDrop-In Peer Tutoring is set up such that students can drop in to study alone or with others and ask questions of a peer leader who has done well in the class. Tutoring is provided for many of the introductory courses in Biology, Chemistry, Economics, Engineering, Mathematics, Physics, and Statistics.

With respect to classroom procedures, this includes:\n\nPolicies regarding masking and social distancing evolve as the public health situation changes. Students are responsible for understanding and complying with current masking, testing, Symptom Tracking, and social distancing requirements.\nIn some classes, masking and/or social distancing may be required as a result of an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accommodation for the instructor or a student in the class even when not generally required on campus. In such cases, the instructor will notify the class.\nNo food is allowed inside classrooms. Drinks are permitted, but please keep your face covering on and use a straw.\nFaculty may assign seats in some classes to help facilitate contact tracing in the event that a student tests positive for COVID-19. Students must sit in their assigned seats.\n\nIf a student fails to comply with the COVID-19 Code of Conduct or other University expectations related to COVID-19, the instructor may ask the student to leave the class. The instructor is asked to report the incident to the Office of Community Standards for additional follow-up.\n\n\nClass Attendance\nClass sessions for this course will occur in person. Individual students will not be granted permission to attend remotely except as the result of an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accommodation as determined by AccessibleNU.\nMaintaining the health of the community remains our priority. If you are experiencing any symptoms of COVID do not attend class and update your Symptom Tracker application right away to connect with Northwestern’s Case Management Team for guidance on next steps. Also contact the instructor as soon as possible to arrange to complete coursework. We plan to record sessions for students that miss to to COVID-19 related issues.\nStudents who experience a personal emergency should contact the instructor as soon as possible to arrange to complete coursework.\nShould public health recommendations prevent in person class from being held on a given day, the instructor or the university will notify students."

All information will remain confidential.\n\n\nRecording\nUnauthorized student recording of classroom or other academic activities is prohibited.3 Unauthorized recording is unethical and may also be a violation of University policy and state law.\nStudents requesting the use of assistive technology as an accommodation should contact AccessibleNU. Unauthorized use of classroom recordings — including distributing or posting them — is also prohibited.\nUnder the University’s Copyright Policy, faculty own the copyright to instructional materials — including those resources created specifically for the purposes of instruction, such as syllabi, lectures and lecture notes, and presentations. Students cannot copy, reproduce, display, or distribute these materials. Students who engage in unauthorized recording, unauthorized use of a recording, or unauthorized distribution of instructional materials will be referred to the appropriate University office for follow-up.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nStudents are responsible for reading and understanding Northwestern’s academic integrity policy4. Suspected violations of academic integrity will be reported to the Weinberg College Dean’s Office5.\n\n\nSexual Misconduct & Reporting\nNorthwestern University is committed to fostering an environment where students are safe and free from sexual misconduct. Confidential resources are available to those who have experienced sexual misconduct.6\nFaculty, instructors, and TAs are not confidential resources and are required to report incidents of sexual misconduct, whether discussed in your assignments or in person, to the Title IX Coordinator, who can provide information about resources and options.\nWe encourage students who have experienced sexual misconduct to talk with someone to get support. For more information, including how to request interim protective measures and academic accommodations or file a complaint, visit the Get Help7.\n\n\nDiscrimination & Sexual Harassment\nNorthwestern University’s policies on Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Harassment apply to all members of the University community, including students, staff, and faculty.

SES works with these students to foster identity development, navigate campus resources, and build community. Through campus-wide partnerships and advocacy, SES strives to build an inclusive Northwestern community that is welcoming, supportive, and accessible for all students.
