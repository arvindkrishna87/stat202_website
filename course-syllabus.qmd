## Learning objectives

By the end of the quarter, you will be able to...

1.  Use statistical software to manage and process data.
2.  Use statistical software to perform exploratory data analyses. That is, explore data numerically and visually to gain understanding through data and generate hypotheses and inferences to later test.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.margin=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/cartoon3308.png', dpi = NA)
```

3.  Recognize the importance of data collection, identify limitations in data collection methods, and determine how they affect the scope of inference.
4.  Build a conceptual understanding of the unified nature of statistical inference.
5.  Apply estimation and testing methods to analyze single variables or the relationship between two variables in order to understand natural phenomena and make data-based decisions.
6.  Model numerical response variables using a single or multiple explanatory variables.
7.  Interpret results in context without relying on statistical jargon.
8.  Critique and evaluate data-based claims and decisions.

## Course Structure

The bulk of this course will follow a flipped or active learning design. Meaning the majority of each lecture will be dedicated to working on activities. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. A typical class will devote 10-15 minutes to discussion/lecture with the remainder of the class devoted to working on activities where students will either work by themselves or in groups. Throughout the class we will discuss and review the work on the activities. In many cases we may come together to work on parts of an activity as a class.

## Textbooks

We will be using [Introduction to Statistics and Data Science](https://nustat.github.io/intro-stat-data-sci/) which is a free online book that we have been developing for this course.

## Software

We will be using/introducing the free statistical software [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/).

## Hardware

Students will need a laptop or Chromebook to be able to follow lectures and to work with RStudio Cloud to complete activities. If access to a laptop is an issue, then please contact the course instructor and we will work to find an accommodation.

## Assessment

Assessment for the course is comprised of five components: participation, reading checks, activities, 3 exams, and a final project.

### Participation

We will be recording participation through [AHA slides](https://ahaslides.com/). Various times throughout the class we may take a poll or ask a question that you will respond to. The link to the site is provided on the "home page" each day. Participation grades will be curved to 80%. Meaning at the end of the quarter, if you participate at least 80% of the time your participation grade will be 100% (but will not exceed 100%). If you participate 70% of the time, at the end of the quarter your grade will be 70%/80%.

*If you have an extenuating circumstance that requires you to miss more than 80% of classes then you should contact your advisor or Accessible NU for an accommodation request.*

### Reading Checks

Reading checks will be completed using "Tutorials" on RStudio Cloud and uploaded to the course Canvas page. Each reading check will be scaled to be worth 10 points.

*The lowest three grades will be dropped at the end of the quarter.*

### Activities

All daily activities will be graded for completion (10 points fully complete; 5 points partially complete; 0 not complete). This doesn't mean that your solutions are correct, so make sure that you check them against the solutions.

*The lowest three grades will be dropped at the end of the quarter.*

### Exams

There will be 3 in-class exams; they will be structured very similarly to your reading checks. Half of it will focus on conceptual knowledge and half will focus on practical applications. Students will be allowed one 8.5 x 11 inch cheat sheet (front & back) on each in-class exams. The exams are not cumulative.

### Project

The final project will be completed in groups of 3-5 people and allow you to explore a dataset of your choice. More information will be provided later in the quarter.

### Exam Improvement Policy

We have worked to develop a policy geared towards a growth mindset. That is, we want a policy where students clearly demonstrate that they have used the exam as a diagnostic tool to learn from and improve their understanding of statistics. There is NO final cumulative exam during the designated final exam time, instead you may choose to retake 1 exam during the exam time. This exam will replace your old score --- only in cases where it is an improvement. You must be on-campus to take the exam.

## Grading

The final course grade will be calculated as follows:

| Category       | Percentage |
|----------------|------------|
| Participation  | 5%         |
| Reading Checks | 15%        |
| Activities     | 10%        |
| Exam 1         | 20%        |
| Exam 2         | 20%        |
| Exam 3         | 20%        |
| Final Project  | 10%        |

The final letter grade will be determined based on the following thresholds:

| Letter Grade | Final Course Grade |
|--------------|--------------------|
| A            | \>= 93             |
| A-           | 90 - 92.9          |
| B+           | 87 - 89.9          |
| B            | 83 - 86.9          |
| B-           | 80 - 82.9          |
| C+           | 77 - 79.9          |
| C            | 73 - 76.9          |
| C-           | 70 - 72.9          |
| D            | 60 - 69.9          |
| F            | \< 59.9            |

## Tips for success

-   Dedicate yourself to being an active and engaged learner.
-   Prepare for class by *reading and working* through code *before* class.
-   Work in groups to learn and complete activities.
-   Ask questions! Ask them during class, office hours, or on Campuswire.
-   Contribute to a welcoming and inclusive learning environment.
-   Don't be afraid to make mistakes, you learn from mistakes.

## Asking Questions & Course Communication

This term we will be using [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/p/G88B46A25) ("Enrollment Code: 7930") as our preferred platform for questions about activities, reading checks, and general course questions. The system is highly catered to getting you help quickly and efficiently from classmates and the instructional team. Rather than emailing questions to the instructional team, you should post your questions on Campuswire.

The instructional team will check Campuswire periodically and answer questions, but we strongly encourage students to answer each other's questions. To this end, student will be able to earn bonus points --- see Canvas for details.

Please do not expect answers during weekends and evenings.

## Academic Resources

[Quarter-Long Study Groups](http://www.northwestern.edu/searle/programs-events/undergrad/group-study/peer-guided-study-groups/index.html) offers peer-led academic support in a small-group setting for students enrolled in this course. If you join the program, you will meet weekly with about 5 to 8 other students and a peer facilitator. During sessions, students review concepts, work through practice problems, raise questions, and work together to develop answers. Students register for the full quarter on CAESAR and weekly attendance is expected. Study Groups sessions are listed below course lecture and discussion sections (e.g., STAT 202-SG Peer-Guided Study Group: Introduction to Statistics).

Contact Borislava Miltcheva (pgsg\@northwestern.edu) with any questions.

### Drop-In Support (No Appointment Needed)

[Drop-In Peer Tutoring](https://www.northwestern.edu/academic-support-learning/course-support/drop-in-peer-tutoring.html) is set up such that students can drop in to study alone or with others and ask questions of a peer leader who has done well in the class. Tutoring is provided for many of the introductory courses in Biology, Chemistry, Economics, Engineering, Mathematics, Physics, and **Statistics**. Check their website for a complete list of supported courses.
