    "text": "EC Opportunity 2 - Campuswire\nWe use Campuswire (see syllabus or welcome page for enrollment code) as our preferred platform for announcements and questions about activities, reading checks, or general course-related questions. (Questions about individual grades or appointments should be addressed through email.)\nThe Campuswire system is designed to get you help quickly and efficiently from your classmates and the instructional team. Rather than emailing your questions to the instructional team, you should post your questions on Campuswire. If a member of the team receives a course-related question via email, they will ask that you post on Campuswire. You can post questions anonymously.\nThe instructional team will check Campuswire periodically to answer students’ questions (do not expect this on weekends or after 5 PM on weekdays). However, we strongly encourage students to answer each other’s questions. Students who participate actively on Campuswire will receive bonus final exam points at the end of the quarter.\nWe measure student participation using the built-in Campuswire reputation system, which awards reputation points based on questions asked, answers given, and upvotes. The levels are as follows:\nStudents gaining Lvl 1: Starter status by the end of the course will have earned 1 bonus final project point;\nStudents gaining Lvl 2: Intermediate status by the end of the course will have earned 2 bonus final project points;\nStudents gaining Lvl 3: Advanced status by the end of the course will have earned 3 bonus final project points.\nNote that the highest level requires upvotes. It benefits all students to upvote their peers for responses that they find useful.\nIn addition, Campuswire provides a list of the top contributors in the class. At the end of the course, the top 3 contributors will have the bonus final project points they earned doubled.\nThis means that a student who is among the top 3 and has the rank of Lvl 3 (Advanced) will receive 6 bonus final project points. If they are top 3 and have a rank of Lvl 2 (Intermediate) they will receive 4 bonus final project points.\nDISCLAIMER\nStudents attempting or participating in an attempt to game the system will be ineligible for bonus points."

Various times throughout the class we may take a poll or ask a question that you will respond to. The link to the site is provided on the “home page” each day. Participation grades will be curved to 80%. Meaning at the end of the quarter, if you participate at least 80% of the time your participation grade will be 100% (but will not exceed 100%). If you participate 70% of the time, at the end of the quarter your grade will be 70%/80%.\nIf you have an extenuating circumstance that requires you to miss more than 80% of classes then you should contact your advisor or Accessible NU for an accommodation request.\n\n\nReading Checks\nReading checks will be completed using “Tutorials” on RStudio Cloud and uploaded to the course Canvas page. Each reading check will be scaled to be worth 10 points.\nThe lowest three grades will be dropped at the end of the quarter.\n\n\nActivities\nAll daily activities will be graded for completion (10 points fully complete; 5 points partially complete; 0 not complete). This doesn’t mean that your solutions are correct, so make sure that you check them against the solutions.\nThe lowest three grades will be dropped at the end of the quarter.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be 3 in-class exams; they will be structured very similarly to your reading checks. Half of it will focus on conceptual knowledge and half will focus on practical applications. Students will be allowed one 8.5 x 11 inch cheat sheet (front & back) on each in-class exams. The exams are not cumulative.\n\n\nProject\nThe final project will be completed in groups of 3-5 people and allow you to explore a dataset of your choice. More information will be provided later in the quarter.\n\n\nExam Improvement Policy\nWe have worked to develop a policy geared towards a growth mindset. That is, we want a policy where students clearly demonstrate that they have used the exam as a diagnostic tool to learn from and improve their understanding of statistics. There is NO final cumulative exam during the designated final exam time, instead you may choose to retake 1 exam during the exam time. This exam will replace your old score — only in cases where it is an improvement. You must be on-campus to take the exam."

This dataset will be located in the RStudio Cloud Project.\n\nClass Survey Data: You cannot use any analysis that is an existing question on your exam. You may think of a similar question but it should not be identical. You must use the full dataset, the midterm and final remove certain columns and observations to reduce time computations. See the codebook for an explanation of the variables.\n\nOption 2:\nAs a group you can pick a dataset of interest to explore! This can be any dataset of your choice that meets the following criteria:\n\nAt least 100 observations\nAt least 10 variables\nThe variables should be a mix of both categorical and numeric\nAt least one variable that can be used as a reasonable response variable for regression\nYou may not use data that has previously been used in any Activity\nYou may not use any data that is a part of the ISDSdatasets, ggplot2, or palmerpenguins packages.\n\nWhere to find data?\n\nSocial Science Data Resources: A LibGuide maintained by Anne Zald from the Northwestern library; this page provides curated links to a number of data sources by subject.\nKaggle: Kaggle offers aggregated datasets, but it’s a community hub rather than a search engine. Kaggle launched in 2010 with a number of machine learning competitions, which subsequently solved problems for the likes of NASA and Ford. It has since evolved into a renowned open data platform, offering cloud-based collaboration for data scientists, as well as educational tools for teaching artificial intelligence and data analysis techniques… plus, of course, tons of great datasets covering almost any topic you can imagine.\nGoogle Dataset Search: Launched in 2018, Google Dataset Search is like Google’s standard search engine, but strictly for data. While it’s not the best tool if you prefer to browse, if you have a particular topic or keyword in mind, it won’t disappoint. Google Dataset Search aggregates data from external sources, providing a clear summary of what’s available, a description of the data, who it’s provided by, and when it was last updated. It’s an excellent place to start.\nU.S. Census Bureau: the U.S. Census Bureau publishes reams of demographic data at the state, city, and even zip code level. It is a fantastic data set for students interested in creating geographic data visualizations and can be accessed on the Census Bureau website. Alternatively, the data can be accessed via an API.\nData.gov: In 2015, the US Government made all its data publicly available. With over 200,000 datasets covering everything from climate change to crime, you can lose yourself in the database for hours. For a government website, it has some surprisingly user-friendly search functions, including the ability to drill down by geographical area, organization type, and file format.
