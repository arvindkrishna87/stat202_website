title: "Final Project"
---

The final project is to be completed in **groups of 3-5**. Why? 1) Group work and collaboration is a good life skill. 2) There is no possible way we can grade 200 projects by the time grades are due.

The final project is due on **Sunday December 4th 11:59pm**. Groups are expected to submit their project electronically to Canvas, similar to how you submit your work for daily activities. You will type your project directly into a qmd file and knit an html document to submit. **Only ONE person** from the group needs to submit the html document. Make sure everyone's name is on the project.

The project should be in complete sentences within the context of your datset when appropriate. Students are expected to also show their work (i.e., include your R code). Your target audience is the grader and myself, we want to see your code and the output of your code.

## Choose a Group

You must join your group on Canvas! Grades are linked to these groups - I will not hunt you down. To get a grade you must be in a group. On Canvas go to the **People** tab, and select **Group** to add yourself to a group.

Everyone in your group must agree to be in your group. I should not be getting emails stating "*Jane Doe* is in my group and we don't know who that is". If you do not know anyone in the class, Groups 1 -5 are titled "Random Join". Anyone can join them. You can communicate with your group through the Canvas group, make a group on Campuswire, or exchange email.

## Choose a Dataset

**Option 1:**

You may use a dataset that I provide. This dataset will be located in the RStudio Cloud Project.

-   **Class Survey Data**: You cannot use any analysis that is an existing question on your exam. You may think of a similar question but it should not be identical. You must use the full dataset, the midterm and final remove certain columns and observations to reduce time computations. See the [**codebook**](/documents/project/survey_fa22_codebook) for an explanation of the variables.


**Option 2:**

As a group you can pick a dataset of interest to explore! This can be any dataset of your choice that meets the following criteria:

-   At least 100 observations

-   At least 10 variables

-   The variables should be a mix of both categorical and numeric

-   At least one variable that can be used as a reasonable response variable for regression

-   You may not use data that has previously been used in any Activity

-   You may not use any data that is a part of the ISDSdatasets, ggplot2, or palmerpenguins packages.

Where to find data?

-   [Social Science Data Resources](https://libguides.northwestern.edu/data): A LibGuide maintained by Anne Zald from the Northwestern library; this page provides curated links to a number of data sources by subject.

-   [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets): Kaggle offers aggregated datasets, but it's a community hub rather than a search engine. Kaggle launched in 2010 with a number of machine learning competitions, which subsequently solved problems for the likes of NASA and Ford. It has since evolved into a renowned open data platform, offering cloud-based collaboration for data scientists, as well as educational tools for teaching artificial intelligence and data analysis techniques... plus, of course, tons of great datasets covering almost any topic you can imagine.

-   [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/): Launched in 2018, Google Dataset Search is like Google's standard search engine, but strictly for data. While it's not the best tool if you prefer to browse, if you have a particular topic or keyword in mind, it won't disappoint. Google Dataset Search aggregates data from external sources, providing a clear summary of what's available, a description of the data, who it's provided by, and when it was last updated. It's an excellent place to start.

-   [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/): the U.S. Census Bureau publishes reams of demographic data at the state, city, and even zip code level. It is a fantastic data set for students interested in creating geographic data visualizations and can be accessed on the Census Bureau website. Alternatively, the data can be accessed via an API.

-   [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/): In 2015, the US Government made all its data publicly available. With over 200,000 datasets covering everything from climate change to crime, you can lose yourself in the database for hours. For a government website, it has some surprisingly user-friendly search functions, including the ability to drill down by geographical area, organization type, and file format. Search results are also clearly labeled at federal, state, county, and city levels.Â 

-   [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/): If you're interested in data at all, you've almost certainly heard of FiveThirtyEight; it's one of the best-established data journalism outlets in the world.

What you may not know is that FiveThirtyEight also makes the data sets used in its articles available online on Github and on its own data portal.

-   [FBI Crime Data Explorer](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/): If you're fascinated by crime, the FBI Crime Data Explorer is the one for you. It provides a broad collection of crime statistics from a variety of state organizations (universities and local law enforcement) and government (on a local, regional, and state-level). Pull data on hate crimes, officer assaults, homicides, and more. It also includes some helpful user guides to support data navigation.
