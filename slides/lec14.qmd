## The Standard Normal Distribution

<center>![](images_lecture/standard_normal.png)</center>

. . .

**Properties**

:::{.incremental}
-   The area under the curve is 1 (or 100%)
-   The mean of the distribution is 0
-   The standard deviation of the distribution is 1
:::

 

**Note**: Can use the normal distribution in R or at https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/\~mbognar/applets/normal.html

## Empirical Rule

:::{.incremental}
-   Around **68%** of values are within **one** standard deviation from the mean.
-   Around **95%** of values are within **two** standard deviations from the mean.
-   Around **99.7%** of values are within **three** standard deviations from the mean.
:::

## Empirical Rule continued

-   **Why is this useful?** If we know the mean and standard deviation of a variable that follows the normal distribution, we can calculate the probability of an event occurring.

-   **How is this applicable?** We can transform any normally distributed variable into a standard normal distribution with **standardization**.

$$\hbox{STAT} = \frac{X - mean(X)}{sd(X)}$$

## The Normal Distribution

-   Changing mu (the mean), changes where the center (peak) of the distribution is located.
-   Changing sigma (the standard deviation), changes the spread of the distribution.
-   The shape of the distribution never changes. It is always unimodal and symmetric (no skew).

## The T-Distribution

The t-distribution is similar in shape to a normal distribution.

## The T-Distribution continued

-   Completely characterized by it's degrees of freedom (df). A parameter defined based on the sample size $n$.
-   As we make the degrees of freedom ($df$) larger the t-distribution is getting closer to the standard normal distribution.
-   The normal distribution assumes that you know the population standard deviation, $\sigma$. The t-distribution is used if you only know the sample standard deviation, $s$ (ie: $\sigma$ unknown).

## The T-Distribution in R

 

```{r t-dist}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
pt(q = -1, df = 9)
qt(p = .025, df = 9)
qt(p = .025, df = 9, lower.tail=FALSE)
```
