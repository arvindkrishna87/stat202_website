**Properties**

::: incremental
-   The area under the curve is 1 (or 100%)
-   The mean of the distribution is 0
-   The standard deviation of the distribution is 1

-   Around **68%** of values are within **one** standard deviation from the mean.
-   Around **95%** of values are within **two** standard deviations from the mean.
-   Around **99.7%** of values are within **three** standard deviations from the mean.

. . .

**Why is this useful?** If we know the mean and standard deviation of a variable that follows the normal distribution, we can calculate the probability of an event occurring.

. . .

**How is this applicable?** We can transform any normally distributed variable into a standard normal distribution with **standardization**.

. . .

$$\hbox{STAT} = \frac{X - mean(X)}{sd(X)}$$

## The Normal Distribution

::: incremental
-   Changing $\mu$ (mu, the mean), changes where the center (peak) of the distribution is located.
-   Changing $\sigma$ (sigma, the standard deviation), changes the spread of the distribution.
-   The shape of the distribution never changes. It is always unimodal and symmetric (no skew).

## The T-Distribution {.smaller}

The t-distribution is similar in shape to a normal distribution.

:::

::: {.column width="52%"}
::: incremental
-   Completely characterized by it's degrees of freedom (df). A parameter defined based on the sample size $n$.
-   As we make the degrees of freedom ($df$) larger the t-distribution is getting closer to the standard normal distribution.
-   The normal distribution assumes that you know the population standard deviation, $\sigma$. The t-distribution is used if you only know the sample standard deviation, $s$ (ie: $\sigma$ unknown).

## Normal and T Distribution in R

**Normal distribution:**

```{r norm-dist}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
# Calculate the probability of being to the left of quantile -1
# Default is mean = 0 and sd = 1
pnorm(q = -1)
# Calculate the quantile, with 20% of data to the left
qnorm(p = .2, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# lower.tail = FALSE changes it to data/area to the right
# specify mean and sd if you are not using a standard normal distribution
qnorm(p = .025, mean = 10, sd = 2, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

**T-distribution:**

```{r t-dist}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
# instead of pnorm we now use pt
# instead of qnorm we now use qt
# no mean and sd! Now we use df
pt(q = -1, df = 9)
qt(p = .025, df = 9)
qt(p = .025, df = 9, lower.tail = FALSE)
```
