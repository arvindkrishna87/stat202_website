## Overview

**Definitions**:

-   Population: collection of individuals (units) in which we are interested
-   Sample: collection of individuals (units) from the population

**Goal**: Use trends in a sample to make inference about a population.

## Notation

Â 

|            | Size | Proportion       | Mean      | Standard Deviation |
|------------|------|------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| Population | N    | $\pi$            | $\mu$     | $\sigma$           |
| Sample     | n    | $p$ or $\hat{p}$ | $\bar{x}$ | $s$                |

## Example 1

In a survey of 1,500 parents in the United States, 73% said they wanted to resume in person school for their children for 2021.

-   Population: parents in the US
-   Sample: 1,500 parents surveyed
-   73% is a sample statistic

## Random Sampling and Assignment

**Random Sampling**: how you draw the observations from the population

-   allows for generalizable claims

**Random Assignment**: how you assign the sample into treatment/control groups

-   allows for causal claims.

## Example 2

You want to evaluate the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine on COVID. You ask for 1,000 volunteers and randomly give half of the volunteers the vaccine and the other half a placebo dose. These people get tested for COVID every week for a year and we record who tests positive for COVID during this time and their symptoms.

-   Random assignment
-   No random sampling

**Conclusions we can draw**: causal conclusion only applicable to the sample

## Types of random sampling

-   **Simple Random**: observations are selected randomly from the population, each having an equal chance of being selected.
-   **Cluster Sampling**: first the population is divided into sub-groups, and then x sub-groups out of all groups are randomly selected (heterogeneous groups; mini representation of the population).

## Types of random sampling continued

-   **Stratified Sampling**: first the population is divided into sub-groups, and then within each sub-group x observations are randomly selected (homogeneous groups).

-   **Systematic Sampling**: select some starting point, then every $k^{th}$ observation of the population is selected.

## Example 3

Northwestern University is deciding which undergraduate students to test for COVID this week and due to limited resources we cannot test the entire undergraduate student body at once.

-   **Population of interest**: undergraduate students at NU
-   **Stratified Sampling Example**: The university divides the population into 4 groups {1st year, sophomore, junior, seniors} and randomly selects 200 students from each group to test.

## Example 3 continued

Northwestern University is deciding which undergraduate students to test for COVID this week and due to limited resources we cannot test the entire undergraduate student body at once.

-   **Systematic Sampling Example**: The university alphabetizes the population by last name and selects every $25^{th}$ student to get tested.
