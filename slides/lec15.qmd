## Overview and Definitions

The theory of **repeated samples** makes it possible for statisticians to take a random sample from a population and use to make inference about that population's parameters.

-   **Repeated Sampling**: repeating the exact same random sampling procedure many times.

-   **Sampling variability**: some sample estimates are bigger and some smaller than the true population statistic

## More Definitions

-   **Standard error**: the standard deviation of a sampling distribution
-   **Sampling Distribution**: a probability distribution of a statistic (mean, proportion, or variation) obtained from repeated sampling. This distribution is visualized with a histogram.

## Simulations in R

The theory of repeated samples is quite straight forward:

1.  Imagine repeating the exact same *random sampling* procedure where you sampled 50 people from the population, say 10,000 times.\
2.  For each of the 10,000 samples, each with 50 people in them, calculate a sample statistic, say the sample mean. That is, you now have 10,000 sample means.

## Simulations in R continued

3.  Now examine the distribution of the 10,000 sample means. This distribution of sample means is know as a sampling distribution. A distribution that is the result of repeated sampling.

**Code in R**:

```{r rep-sample}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
sim_data <- data %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 10000)
```
