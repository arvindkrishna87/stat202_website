Use statistical software to manage and process data.\n2.  Use statistical software to perform exploratory data analyses. That is, explore data numerically and visually to gain understanding through data and generate hypotheses and inferences to later test.\n\n::: {.cell fig.margin='true'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/cartoon3308.png){width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n3.  Recognize the importance of data collection, identify limitations in data collection methods, and determine how they affect the scope of inference.\n4.  Build a conceptual understanding of the unified nature of statistical inference.\n5.  Apply estimation and testing methods to analyze single variables or the relationship between two variables in order to understand natural phenomena and make data-based decisions.\n6.  Model numerical response variables using a single or multiple explanatory variables.\n7.  Interpret results in context without relying on statistical jargon.\n8.  Critique and evaluate data-based claims and decisions.\n\n\n## Course Structure\n\nThe bulk of this course will follow a flipped or active learning design. Meaning the majority of each lecture will be dedicated to working on activities. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. A typical class will devote 10-15 minutes to discussion/lecture with the remainder of the class devoted to working on activities where students will either work by themselves or in groups. Throughout the class we will discuss and review the work on the activities. In many cases we may come together to work on parts of an activity as a class.\n\n\n## Textbooks\n\nWe will be using [Introduction to Statistics and Data Science](https://nustat.github.io/intro-stat-ds/) which is a free online book that we have been developing for this course.\n\n## Software\n\nWe will be using/introducing the free statistical software [RStudio Cloud](https://rstuido.cloud/).\n\n## Hardware\n\nStudents will need a laptop or Chromebook to be able to follow lectures and to work with RStudio Cloud to complete activities. If access to a laptop is an issue, then please contact the course instructor and we will work to find an accommodation.\n\n\n## Assessment\n\nAssessment for the course is comprised of six components: attendance, reading checks, activities, projects, midterm exam, and final exam.\n\n### Attendance\n\n\n### Reading Checks\n\n*The lowest three grades will be dropped at the end of the semester.*\n\n### Activities\n\n*The lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.*\n\n### Projects\n\nThe projects will focus on practical application of course material. More information about the project will be provided during the quarter.\n\n### Midterm Exam\n\nThe midterm exam will focus on conceptual knowledge of course material and be taken in-class through the IMathAS software. Students will be allowed one 8.5 x 11 inch cheat sheet (front & back) on the in-class exams. \n\n### Final Exam\n\nThe final exam will be structured similarly and taken in-class through the IMathAS software. Students will be allowed one 8.5 x 11 inch cheat sheet (front & back) on the in-class exams.\n\n### Midterm Exam Improvement Policy\n\nWe have worked to develop a policy geared towards a growth mindset. That is, we want a policy where students clearly demonstrate that they have used the midterm as a diagnostic tool to learn from and improve their understanding of statistics. Since the final is cumulative we have settled on a policy where we will replace your in-class midterm score with your in-class final score --- only in cases where it is an improvement\n\n## Grading\n\nThe final course grade will be calculated as follows:\n\n| Category              | Percentage      |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|\n| Reading Checks        | 25%             |\n| Activities            | 15%             |\n| Project 1             | 10%             |\n| Project 2             | 10%             |\n| Midterm Exam          | 20%             |\n| Final Exam            | 20%             |\n\nThe final letter grade will be determined based on the following thresholds:\n\n| Letter Grade | Final Course Grade |\n|--------------|--------------------|\n| A            | \\>= 93             |\n| A-           | 90 - 92.99         |\n| B+           | 87 - 89.99         |\n| B            | 83 - 86.99         |\n| B-           | 80 - 82.99         |\n| C+           | 77 - 79.99         |\n| C            | 73 - 76.99         |\n| C-           | 70 - 72.99         |\n| D+           | 67 - 69.99         |\n| D            | 63 - 66.99         |\n| D-           | 60 - 62.99         |\n| F            | \\< 60              |\n\n## Tips for success\n\n-   Dedicate yourself to being an active and engaged learner.\n-   Prepare for class by *reading and working* through code *before* class.\n-   Work in groups to learn and complete activities.\n-   Ask questions! Ask them during class, office hours, or on Campuswire.\n-   Contribute to a welcoming and inclusive learning environment.\n-   Don't be afraid to make mistakes, you learn from mistakes.\n\n\n## Asking Questions & Course Communication\n\nThis term we will be using [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/p/GDD23C511) (\"Enrollment Code: 6232\") as our preferred platform for questions about activities, reading checks, and general course questions. The system is highly catered to getting you help quickly and efficiently from classmates and the instructional team. Rather than emailing questions to the instructional team, you should post your questions on Campuswire.\n\nThe instructional team will check Campuswire periodically and answer questions, but we strongly encourage students to answer each other's questions. To this end, student will be able to earn bonus points --- see Canvas for details.\n\nPlease do not expect answers during weekends and evenings.\n\n\n\n## Academic Resources\n\n[Quarter-Long Study Groups](http://www.northwestern.edu/searle/programs-events/undergrad/group-study/peer-guided-study-groups/index.html) offers peer-led academic support in a small-group setting for students enrolled in this course. If you join the program, you will meet weekly with about 5 to 8 other students and a peer facilitator. During sessions, students review concepts, work through practice problems, raise questions, and work together to develop answers. Students register for the full quarter on CAESAR and weekly attendance is expected. Study Groups sessions are listed below course lecture and discussion sections (e.g., STAT 202-SG Peer-Guided Study Group: Introduction to Statistics).\n\nContact Borislava Miltcheva (borislava.miltcheva@northwestern.edu) with any questions.\n\n### Drop-In Support (No Appointment Needed)\n\n[Drop-In Peer Tutoring](https://www.northwestern.edu/academic-support-learning/course-support/drop-in-peer-tutoring.html) is set up such that students can drop in to study alone or with others and ask questions of a peer leader who has done well in the class. Tutoring is provided for many of the introductory courses in Biology, Chemistry, Economics, Engineering, Mathematics, Physics, and **Statistics**. Check their website for a complete list of supported courses.\n\nContact Krystal Wilson (krystal.wilson@northwestern.edu) with any questions.\n\n\n## COVID-19 Policies\n\n### Classroom Expectations\n\nStudents, faculty, and staff must comply with University expectations regarding appropriate classroom behavior, including those outlined below and in the [COVID-19 Code of Conduct](https://www.northwestern.edu/communitystandards/about-us/northwestern-university-student-expectations-covid-19-code-of-conduct.html)^[Internet search: \"Northwestern Code of Conduct\"].
